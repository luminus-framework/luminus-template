### Managing Your Middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `{{name}}.middleware` namespace.
A request logging helper called `log-request` has already been defined for you there.

This namespace also defines two vectors for organizing the middleware called `development-middleware` and `production-middleware`.
Any middleware that you only wish to run in development mode, such as `log-request`, should be added to the first vector.
